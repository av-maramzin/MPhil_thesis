abstract="The decision to inline aÂ procedure in the Open Research Compiler (ORC) was based on aÂ temperature heuristics that takes into consideration the time spent in aÂ procedure and the size of the procedure. In this paper we describe the trade-off that has to be worked out to make the correct inlining decisions. We introduce two new heuristics to enhance the ORC inlining heuristics: adaptation and cycle{\_}density. With adaptation we are allowed to vary the temperature threshold and prevent penalizing small benchmarks. With cycle{\_}density we prevent the inlining of procedures that have aÂ high temperature in spite of being called infrequently. Experiments show that while adaptation improves the speedup obtained with inlining across the SPEC2000 suite, cycle{\_}density reduces significantly both the code growth and compilation time increase caused by inlining. We then characterize the SPEC INT2000 benchmarks according to the inlining potential of their function calls. Our enhancement is released in the ORC 2.0.",

  abstract  = "In the last decade, machine-learning-based compilation has moved from an obscure research niche to a mainstream activity. In this paper, we describe the relationship between machine learning and compiler optimization and introduce the main concepts of features, models, training, and deployment. We then provide a comprehensive survey and provide a road map for the wide variety of different research areas. We conclude with a discussion on open issues in the area and potential research directions. This paper provides both an accessible introduction to the fast moving area of machine-learning-based compilation and a detailed bibliography of its main achievements.",
